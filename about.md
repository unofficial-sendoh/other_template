I’m an undergrad student and currently majoring in Electronics & Communication Engineering at Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, Khulna, Bangladesh.

Data Science , Deep Learning , Chat Bot , Augmented Reality , Digital Image Processing are such technologies which attracts me most. When it comes down to coding, my choice are primarily Python , C++ , Swift and JavaScript. I enjoy coding and love to work on open source tech and also all of my work git hub repositories is open sourced and always will be.

I’m passionate about applying my knowledge of data science and machine learning to areas in crime cast and healthcare where we can really engineer some better solutions.I have a great interest in sharing my knowledge in my field of expertise.. I’ve been developing my skills since my sophomore year at the university. I am a life long learner and always get thrilled to try something new.

If you’re working in the crime cast and healthcare, don’t hesitate to reach out if you think there’s an opportunity for collaboration. Would love to discuss.
