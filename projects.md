### Motivation :
When people think about self-driving cars, they naturally think about, well, cars. They imagine a future where they buy a new car that has a "self drive" button that takes them wherever they want to go.

That will happen eventually. But the impact of self-driving technology is likely to be much broader than that. Our roads are full of trucks, taxis, buses, shuttles, delivery vans, and more—all of these vehicles will have self-driving equivalents within a decade or two.

The advent of self-driving technology will transform the design possibilities for all sorts of vehicles, giving rise to new vehicle categories that don't exist now and others that straddle the line between existing categories. It will also change the economics of transportation and delivery services, making on-demand delivery a much faster, cheaper, and more convenient option.

> Project Requirements :

### Hardware
This is university level project and choose following component to build autonomous car ,

1. Raspberry Pi
2. Sonar Sesnor
3. Web Cam 
4. Motor + Toy Car + External Battaries
6. 64 GB Micro SD Card ( at least ) 
7. others...

### Software 

1. Python + Tensor Flow + Open CV
2. Raspbian OS ( for raspberry pi )
3. FFmpeg ( multimedia web framework )
4. RESTFull API ( using Node.Js )
5. others...

> Work Approach : A supervised approach.

- Collect Data - using ( webcam + ffmpeg )
- Clean Data and split it , test and train data sets
- Feed the different type of model using the train data sets
- Validate the model using test explanatory data sets
- Identify the best performing model
- Deploy the model
