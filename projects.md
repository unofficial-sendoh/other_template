## [Kaggle Competitions](https://github.com/iphton/Kaggle-Competition)
**Tech Used**: Data Analysis - Feature Engineering - Python 3 - Machine Learning

- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iphton/Kaggle-Competition/blob/gh-pages/Titanic%20Competition/Notebook/Predict%20survival%20on%20the%20Titanic.ipynb#5-bullet): I barely remember first when exactly I watched Titanic movie but still now Titanic remains a discussion subject in the most diverse areas. In this kaggle challenge, we're asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we're asked to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. I've used cross-validation on the top 10 most popular classification models and based on scoring finally choose five most promising classifiers and fine-tuned the models. I used Voting Classifier to combine the predictions coming from classifiers. The model gets an accuracy of around 84%.
