## [Cardio-XAttentionNet*](https://iphton.github.io/iphton.github.io/projects/)
**Techs**: Image Processing - Deep Learning 

We develop an robust deep neural attention mechanism which can detect cardiomegaly from the chest X-ray. We propose a novel deep learning model (**Cardio-XAttentionNet**) trained on ChestX-Ray14 which is publicly available chest X-ray dataset that contains over 100,000 X-ray images, each of which annotated with almost 14 diseases.


## [Deep Toxic Detector*](https://iphton.github.io/iphton.github.io/projects/)
**Techs**: Natural Language Processing - Deep Learning - Feature Engineering - Word Embeddings

An Ensemble Deep Neural Networks of Capsule Network With Attention Mechanism. We're worked on a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The model predicts a probability the toxicity for each comment.


## [Datathon](https://axiata.com/datathon/bd/index.html)
**Techs**: Apache Spark - Feature Engineering - GCP - Machine Learning - Big Data Analytics

Datathon Bangladesh 2019 is Bangladeshâ€™s first and biggest datathon revolving around the role of Big Data and Machine Learning in solving business problems organised by Robi Axiata Ltd. and supported by Axiata Analytics. We received a big data set related to fintech. The challenge revolves around data analytics, feature engineering, big data analytics, and applied data science algorithm.  


## [Kaggle](https://github.com/iphton/Kaggle-Competition)
**Techs**: Data Analysis - Feature Engineering - Python 3 - Deep Learning

- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iphton/Kaggle-Competition/blob/gh-pages/Titanic%20Competition/Notebook/Predict%20survival%20on%20the%20Titanic.ipynb#5-bullet): We're asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. I've used cross-validation on the top 10 most popular classification models and based on scoring, finally took top five most promising classifiers and fine-tuned those models. An end up with Voting Classifier to combine the predictions coming from the classifiers. The model gets an accuracy of around **84%**. 

- [Digit Classification](https://github.com/iphton/Kaggle-Competition/tree/gh-pages/Digit%20Recognizer): The goal is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is. We've implemented [Capsule Network](https://github.com/iphton/Kaggle-Competition/tree/gh-pages/Digit%20Recognizer/CapsuleNet) and also [Convolutional Network](https://github.com/iphton/Kaggle-Competition/tree/gh-pages/Digit%20Recognizer/ConvNet) architectures and both has achieved **99%+** accuracy.
