### Motivation :
When people think about self-driving cars, they naturally think about, well, cars. They imagine a future where they buy a new car that has a "self drive" button that takes them wherever they want to go.

That will happen eventually. But the impact of self-driving technology is likely to be much broader than that. Our roads are full of trucks, taxis, buses, shuttles, delivery vans, and more—all of these vehicles will have self-driving equivalents within a decade or two.

The advent of self-driving technology will transform the design possibilities for all sorts of vehicles, giving rise to new vehicle categories that don't exist now and others that straddle the line between existing categories. It will also change the economics of transportation and delivery services, making on-demand delivery a much faster, cheaper, and more convenient option.

> Project Requirements :

### Hardware
This is university level project and choose following component to build autonomous car ,

1. Raspberry Pi
2. Sonar Sesnor
3. Web Cam 
4. Motor + Toy Car + External Battaries
6. 64 GB Micro SD Card ( at least ) 
7. others...

### Software 

1. Python + Tensor Flow + Open CV
2. Raspbian OS ( for raspberry pi )
3. FFmpeg ( multimedia web framework )
4. RESTFull API ( using Node.Js )
5. others...

> Work Approach : A supervised approach.

- Collect Data - using ( webcam + ffmpeg )
- Clean Data and split it , test and train data sets
- Feed the different type of model using the train data sets
- Validate the model using test explanatory data sets
- Identify the best performing model
- Deploy the model



## [Tech Zone BD | E-Learning for Developer and Designer](https://github.com/iphton/Tech-Zone)
**Tech Used**: ASP.net - C# - MS SQL

</p>


Tech Zone BD will provide technical information on Windows OS & Android OS. Community will provide Trick , Tips about both OS.

Hardware & Software will be major focused. In the Code Section it will be the best point to learn some of most popular programming language such as C/C++ - Python - Swift - Java - C# and also in aditional language such as Matlab & Arduino Code etc. It will be a great journey for new programmer to have such website where he can learn such new things and find help in a great respect.

One of the great thing that one can get is Community Support. One can share their creative work with others & let other know what he/she is cabale of.



## [Control Raspberry Pi GPIO with Web-Sockets](https://github.com/iphton/Raspberry-Pi-WebSocket)
**Tech Used**: Node.JS - Tornado - Web Socket - Raspberry Pi 3

In this project we built a web based circuit controller system using Raspberry Pi in real time. Web-socket - can be run together with a normal HTTP server. We've tested two approaches - using Node ( server environment ) and also using Tornado ( Python web framework ).

You can click a button in a web browser, and enable a GPIO on your Raspberry Pi which turns on a light in your house. All in real time, and with communication going both ways!



## [Data Scraping](https://github.com/iphton/Data-Scraping)
**Tech Used**: Python 3 - Selenium - Beautiful Soup - Scrapy

This was just for Fun-type project to scrap data from various web site. Here we used Python and it's some powerful packages like selenium , beautiful soup , scrap , request etc.

Selected Sites for data scraping were : 

**Amazon**

- Scrap best seller book list

- Scrap most valuable comment

- Describing info for a book

**IMDB**

- Download all top rated movie poster

- Scrap top rated movies

**Linked In**

- Scrap information of targt individual

- Load n tinmes pages at a time

**Udemy**

- Scrap list of best selling courses



## [MovieLens-IMDB-Analysis](https://github.com/iphton/MovieLens-IMDB-Analysis)
**Tech Used**: Data Analysis - Python 3 - Numpy - Pandas - Matplotlib - Machine Learning - Sckit-Learn

IMDB Movie Dataset. Our research question is What types of movies genres user viewed and rated most than other movies genres ? We take some general approach to solve it. We successfully find the relationship between genres and ratings value including average ratings value with concern launch year.

We want find the most rated genres in the given movies data set. Our goal is to find what types of movies user like most and rated most as well. We have to merge two data set for this purpose and doing some operation on it to get the desire result.If we’re asked what genres people like most and vote them as well. Here we try to give the answer.

We are using the following dataset : IMDB Movie Dataset This dataset describe 5-star ratings and free-text tagging activity from , a move recommendation service. It contains 20000263 ratings and 465564 tags applications across 27278 movies. These data were created by 138493 user between January 09 1995 and March 31 , 2015.

The data are contained in six files links.csv , movies.csv , ratings.csv and tags.csv etc. In this project we will use only two but massive csv files which is movies.csv and ratings.csv.

Data Set can be get from this site : [Data Sets](http://grouplens.org/datasets/)
