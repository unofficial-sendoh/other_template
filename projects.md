## [Autonomous | Self-Driving Car ( In Progress )](https://github.com/iphton/Self-Driving-Car)
**Tech Used**: Deep Learning - Python 3 - OpenCV - TensorFlow - Raspberry Pi 3 

### Motivation :
When people think about self-driving cars, they naturally think about, well, cars. They imagine a future where they buy a new car that has a "self drive" button that takes them wherever they want to go.

That will happen eventually. But the impact of self-driving technology is likely to be much broader than that. Our roads are full of trucks, taxis, buses, shuttles, delivery vans, and more—all of these vehicles will have self-driving equivalents within a decade or two.

The advent of self-driving technology will transform the design possibilities for all sorts of vehicles, giving rise to new vehicle categories that don't exist now and others that straddle the line between existing categories. It will also change the economics of transportation and delivery services, making on-demand delivery a much faster, cheaper, and more convenient option.

> Project Requirements :

### Hardware
This is university level project and choose following component to build autonomous car ,

1. Raspberry Pi
2. Sonar Sesnor
3. Web Cam 
4. Motor + Toy Car + External Battaries
6. 64 GB Micro SD Card ( at least ) 
7. others...

### Software 

1. Python + Tensor Flow + Open CV
2. Raspbian OS ( for raspberry pi )
3. FFmpeg ( multimedia web framework )
4. RESTFull API ( using Node.Js )
5. others...

> Work Approach : A supervised approach.

- Collect Data - using ( webcam + ffmpeg )
- Clean Data and split it , test and train data sets
- Feed the different type of model using the train data sets
- Validate the model using test explanatory data sets
- Identify the best performing model
- Deploy the model



## [Tech Zone BD | E-Learning for Developer and Designer](https://github.com/iphton/Tech-Zone)
**Tech Used**: ASP.net - C# - MS SQL

  <img width="700" height="353" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17668390/39472389-d9a0a538-4cfd-11e8-8b99-f6bfe3e3f9c6.jpg">
</p>


Tech Zone BD will provide technical information on Windows OS & Android OS. Community will provide Trick , Tips about both OS.

Hardware & Software will be major focused. In the Code Section it will be the best point to learn some of most popular programming language such as C/C++ - Python - Swift - Java - C# and also in aditional language such as Matlab & Arduino Code etc. It will be a great journey for new programmer to have such website where he can learn such new things and find help in a great respect.

One of the great thing that one can get is Community Support. One can share their creative work with others & let other know what he/she is cabale of.



## [Control Raspberry Pi GPIO with Web-Sockets](https://github.com/iphton/Raspberry-Pi-WebSocket)
**Tech Used**: Node.JS - Tornado - Web Socket - Raspberry Pi 3

In this project we built a web based circuit controller system using Raspberry Pi in real time. Web-socket - can be run together with a normal HTTP server. We've tested two approaches - using Node ( server environment ) and also using Tornado ( Python web framework ).

You can click a button in a web browser, and enable a GPIO on your Raspberry Pi which turns on a light in your house. All in real time, and with communication going both ways!



## [Data Scraping](https://github.com/iphton/Data-Scraping)
**Tech Used**: Python 3 - Selenium - Beautiful Soup - Scrapy
