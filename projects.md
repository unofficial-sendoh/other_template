- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iphton/Kaggle-Competition/blob/gh-pages/Titanic%20Competition/Notebook/Predict%20survival%20on%20the%20Titanic.ipynb#5-bullet): I barely remember first when exactly I watched Titanic movie but still now Titanic remains a discussion subject in the most diverse areas. Here, we're asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. I've used cross-validation on the top 10 most popular classification models and based on scoring, finally choose five most promising classifiers and fine-tuned those models. I've further used Voting Classifier to combine the predictions coming from classifiers. The model gets an accuracy of around **84%**. 

- [Digit Classification](https://github.com/iphton/Kaggle-Competition/tree/gh-pages/Digit%20Recognizer): The goal in this competition is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is. For every **ImageId** in the test set, we should predict the correct label. We've implemented two architectures stated following and both has achieved **99%+** accuracy. 
  - [Capsule Network](https://github.com/iphton/Kaggle-Competition/tree/gh-pages/Digit%20Recognizer/CapsuleNet): **Geoffrey Hinton** proposed this architecture that introduced a completely new type of neural network based on so-called **Capsules**. Geoffrey Hinton - [Paper: Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829). I found [this](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/introducing-capsule-networks) blog post by **Aurélien Géron** well explained on this topic. <br>
  - [Convolutional Network](https://github.com/iphton/Kaggle-Competition/tree/gh-pages/Digit%20Recognizer/ConvNet): One of the most profoundly used feed forward neural net for image classification and massively well known for it's various types of implementation in computer vision spheres such as *AlexNet*, *VGGNet*, *ResNet*, *Xception*, *Inception* etc.
