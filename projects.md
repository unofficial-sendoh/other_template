## [MovieLens-IMDb-Analysis](https://github.com/iphton/MovieLens-IMDB-Analysis)
**Tech Used**: Data Analysis - Python 3 - Machine Learning

[GroupLens Movie Data Sets](http://grouplens.org/datasets/)

This dataset describe 5-star ratings and free-text tagging activity from , a move recommendation service. It contains **20000263** ratings and **465564** tags applications across **27278** movies. These data were created by **138493** user between January 09 1995 and March 31 , 2015. The data are contained in six files `links.csv` , `movies.csv` , `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv` etc.


## [Kaggle Competitions](https://github.com/iphton/Kaggle-Competition)
**Tech Used**: Data Analysis - Feature Engineering - Python 3 - Machine Learning

- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iphton/Kaggle-Competition/blob/gh-pages/Titanic%20Competition/Notebook/Predict%20survival%20on%20the%20Titanic.ipynb#5-bullet): I barely remember first when exactly I watched Titanic movie but still now Titanic remains a discussion subject in the most diverse areas. In this kaggle challenge, we're asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we're asked to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. I've used cross-validation on the top 10 most popular classification models and based on scoring finally choose five most promising classifiers and fine-tuned the models. I used Voting Classifier to combine the predictions coming from classifiers. The model gets an accuracy of around 84%.

## [Self-Driving Car](https://github.com/iphton/Self-Driving-Car) ### In Progress
**Tech Used**: Deep Learning - Python 3 - OpenCV - TensorFlow - Raspberry Pi 3 

### Motivation :
When people think about self-driving cars, they naturally think about, well, cars. They imagine a future where they buy a new car that has a "self drive" button that takes them wherever they want to go.

That will happen eventually. But the impact of self-driving technology is likely to be much broader than that. Our roads are full of trucks, taxis, buses, shuttles, delivery vans, and more—all of these vehicles will have self-driving equivalents within a decade or two.

The advent of self-driving technology will transform the design possibilities for all sorts of vehicles, giving rise to new vehicle categories that don't exist now and others that straddle the line between existing categories. It will also change the economics of transportation and delivery services, making on-demand delivery a much faster, cheaper, and more convenient option.
